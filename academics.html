        <h1>OUR CURRICULUM</h1>

        <p>The academic work at The Exalter Minaret Schools is guided by educational principles of the Nigerian curriculum blended with the British curriculum. Learning in the Basic Section is enriched with the Cambridge Primary curriculum in Mathematics,
            English studies and Science while the Preschool (preparatory and nursery) Section enjoys a functional EYFS system. Our dynamic curriculum ensures learners’ active involvement and immense exposure to achieve and obtain academic excellence.
            We believe that our learners are future catalyst of growth in the world’s economy. We recognize the need to make them highly competitive; hence we have chosen three reputable languages for instructions namely English, Arabic and French as
            well as two local languages which are Yoruba and any other language(s) We have developed a curriculum that has extensive extra and cross-curricular linkages, project -enquiry based and focused on building a life-long learning that will ensure
            success in the 21st century. Skills like Critical thinking, efficiency, reasoning, fluency, teamwork, commitment and dependability are employed in learners’ daily academic procedures. We develop a deeper assessment that includes the formative,
            diagnostic and summative aspects which are designed for making learners’ academic work more productive. We adopt different learning techniques to facilitate and enhance better understanding of the learners’ academic experiences. Our teachers
            are seasoned, experienced and certified professionals. With them, the learners develop standard academic confidence which has over time made the learners to perform excellently in both their internal and external examinations. At TEMS Preschool,
            we aim at creating a friendly, Islamic and homely environment for every child with lots of learning opportunities. We offer the child the scope to acquire skills to communicate; gain confidence and most of all, have fun. We also facilitate
            the child’s physical, intellectual, emotional, spiritual and social growth alongside language development. These skills will be developed through a child’s organised initiative and imagination. Therefore, this scope of learning is of maximum
            benefit to the child.</p>
